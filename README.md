By chance, I asked Chat GPT for a problem that can be done by programming, and he said this:

Write a program that implements the number guessing game with the following rules:
The computer randomly selects an integer between 1 and 100.
The user must try to guess this number.
After each guess, the computer tells the user whether the selected number is larger or smaller.
If the user guesses a number bigger than the computer's number 5 times in a row, the program should tell him that his number is too big and suggest that he try smaller numbers.
Similarly, if the user guesses a number smaller than the computer's number 5 times in a row, the program should tell him that his number is too small and suggest that he try bigger numbers.
If the user guesses the correct number, the program should display the total number of guesses and the game ends.
